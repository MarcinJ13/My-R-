#Shading Trick for ggplot

This is the trick I have used to shade space between two functions.

First let's prepare function to be drawn.

```R
WeightFunct <- function(x, weights) {
  y=weights[1]
  for (i in 2:length(weights)) {
    y = y+weights[i]*(x^(i-1))
  }
  return(y)
}
```

This will create the function that accepts x and weights. first weight is intercept. Subsequent weights are for powers of X.
For example if you pass weights -1,0.2,0.3,-0.1 it will be basically function y= -1 + 0.2*x^1 + 0.3*x^2 - 0.1*x^3

so let's try this 

```R
simple_weights_1 = matrix(  c(-1, 0.2, 0.3, -0.1),  nrow=1,  ncol=4) 
emptydata <- data.frame()
ggplot(emptydata) + xlim(-5, 5) + ylim(-5, 5) +
  stat_function(fun = WeightFunct,  args = list(weights = simple_weights_1), aes(color="simple_weights_1"))
```

Now example with two function (with different weights)

```R
simple_weights_1 = matrix(  c(0.1, -0.5, -0.025, 0.05),  nrow=1,  ncol=4) 
simple_weights_2 = matrix(  c(1, -0.5, -0.002, 0.012),  nrow=1,  ncol=4) 
emptydata <- data.frame()
g_base <- ggplot(emptydata) + xlim(-5, 5) + ylim(-5, 5) +
  stat_function(fun = WeightFunct,  args = list(weights = simple_weights_1), aes(color="simple_weights_1"))+
  stat_function(fun = WeightFunct,  args = list(weights = simple_weights_2), aes(color="simple_weights_2"))
g_base
```

The problem is how to shade area between those two functions. The trick is to build the diagram, extract points and use them to create ribbon

```R
g_base_build <- ggplot_build(g_base)
```

Now we can extract data from this buld. it has g_base_build$data sections. Now we can extract part of it (in this example x and y from part 1 and y from part 2)

```R
base_dataframe <- data.frame(x = g_base_build$data[[1]]$x,
                  ymin = g_base_build$data[[1]]$y,
                  ymax = g_base_build$data[[2]]$y) 
```

Finally we can use this data frame to create ribbon in our original diagram.


```R
ggplot(emptydata)  + xlim(-5, 5) + ylim(-5, 5) + 
  geom_ribbon(data = base_dataframe, aes(x = x, ymin = ymin, ymax = ymax),fill = "grey", alpha = 0.4)+
  stat_function(fun = WeightFunct,  args = list(weights = simple_weights_1), aes(color="simple_weights_1"))+
  stat_function(fun = WeightFunct,  args = list(weights = simple_weights_2), aes(color="simple_weights_2"))
```

I'm fully aware that this is not perfect solution but at this moment best I could find for creating shaded area between two functions.
