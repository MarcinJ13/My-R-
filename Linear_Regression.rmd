#Linear Regression 1

First load sample data. Sample data was created using Micorsoft Excel. 
First line changes working directory to the location of the csv file.
Then csv file is loaded. Data is already split to TRAIN,VALIDATION and TEST sets as additional column.
Three subsets are created.
```R
setwd("C:/your/file/directory")
Sample1 = read.csv("Sample_Data_single_X.csv")
TrainSet = subset(Sample1,Set=="TRAIN")
ValidationSet = subset(Sample1,Set=="VALIDATION")
TestSet = subset(Sample1,Set=="TEST")
```
Train set has 2500 rows.
To use smaller sets three subsets are defined for 5,20 and 50 rows.
```R
TrainSetTiny = TrainSet[1:5,]
TrainSetSmall = TrainSet[1:20,]
TrainSetMed = TrainSet[1:50,]
```
Lets define the simple polynomial model for TrainSetSmall
First line creates linear model for relation of Y and 7-degree polynomials of X1
Second line creates predictions using this model based on TrainSetSmall
```R
TSS_model_poly_7 = lm(Y ~ poly(X1, 7),data=TrainSetSmall)
TSS_model_poly_7_predictions = predict(TSS_model_poly_7, TrainSetSmall)
```
Visualization of this data
First line loads ggplot library to make diagrams.
It can be installed using command: install.packages("ggplot2")
Second line generates simple plot with points showing data.
Third line saves the diagram as png image.
```R
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(TrainSetSmall, aes(x=X1, y=Y)) + geom_point()
ggsave("LRDaiagram1.png")
```
